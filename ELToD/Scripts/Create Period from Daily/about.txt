Originally from the ELToDv3 Analyst application.
Extracted the AM correlation script out of: Renumber Trip Matrices #5 \ AM Peak Period #1 step. 
USE:  Correlate.s after editing the COMPRESS.PRN for the correlation of zones between the two matrix designs.
Then,
Created a script to factor the daily matrix into three period matrices.
	make sure to use the correct period factors
USE:  Matrix_Factor.s after editing the factors appropriately to add up to 1.0 so not to overestimate the periods.
