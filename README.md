# ELToD_Model
Express Lanes Time of Day Model

This repository holds all ELToD versions along with ongoing work. The release tabs show the model versions.

Currently only static assignment models are in used for project applications. The dynamic assignment version ELToD v 3.0 needs to be re-written for runtime efficiency and to cover other planning needs.

## Static Assignment Models:
1. ELToD v 2.2: Old Policy
2. ELToD v 2.3: New Policy
3. ELToD v 2.3.1: Combined Old & New Policies
4. ELToD v 2.3.2: Integrated Policies

## DTA Models:
- ELToD 3.0 shall be on a different project or branch
- ELToD 4.0 shall be on a different project or branch

At some point, dynamic versions (ELToD 3.0 and ongoing ELToD v 4.0) shall be maintained here possibly as separate branch.
